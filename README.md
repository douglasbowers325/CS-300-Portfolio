# CS-300-Portfolio

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  Throughout this course, we have learned to use the different types of data models such as binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists to have a better understanding of the appropriate time to use them. We learned to conceptualize, design, and construct software programs with the capability to perform diverse operations. These operations included loading, sorting, printing, searching, deleting, addingd, inserting, and updating provided datasets accordingly.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  When approaching the different problems, I first understood the importance of comprehending each data structure and model. It is important to grasp the underlying concept of each data structure as it will help with problem solving and making informed decisions. Data structures are important to understand because they are what effective sollutions rely on. They provide the needed framework when organizing and sorting data, therefore influencing the efficiency and capabilities of the program. It is also important to understand the different strengths and weaknesses of each data structure such as complexity, memory usage, and suitability.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  When overcoming roadblocks I encountered, I refered back to any documents that were available to look for examples related to the given issue I was having. I also incorporated instructor feedback, utilized sample code, and analyzed any complex solutions that were needed for my solutions.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  It has made me aware of the importance of finding the appropriate structure when designing and developing programs. You have to understand the capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses associated with each structure to utilize them to their full potential. I now think more systematicaly when coding as I have learned to prioritize analysis first, evaluating the different options and their implications. 

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  It has taught me how to break down my code into smaller sections. This enhances clarity and organization, while also fostering independence when creating functions. It has also taught me the importance of encapsulations and seperation, which helps create more maintainable and easier to navigate code.
